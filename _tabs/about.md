Currently pursuing B.Tech in Electrical Engineering, I am a software developer by passion, and compassionate soul by heart :)

I usually code in Javascript and Python, with a main focus on backend development. I have some experience working with NodeJs, ReactJs and FastAPI. Still learning more about DevOps and its intricacies!! 🤓

I am intrigued by the world of cryptography and cryptanalysis, and so with my limited knowledge, I try to write sometimes about it.
