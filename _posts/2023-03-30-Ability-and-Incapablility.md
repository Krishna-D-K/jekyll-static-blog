The times are tough. Yes, life is harsh to us many times, but neither am I any soft to it. There are situations in life that need us to make tough decisions, decisions whose consequences are aware to us, whose executions are completely possible for us, decisions we are confident enough to fly out victorious, and decisions that have long-term implications over our life. You know that this could be your shot, and you're completely ready for it, but some small, trivial, yet important factor holds you back. 

> ##### These times are so hard, and it's getting even harder... 

We don't question our decisions when we're having a good time, it happens when the times get harder. And these decisions seem to be a mistake looking back. Trapping us in an endless loop of self-doubt. We tend to unsee the thin line between our ability and incapability, thinking and questioning our capability and losing faith in one's capacity. The difference between them is so disillusionized that it may affect our future decisions and our fate. But one needs to understand that our incapability does not entirely depict our ability and the same is true for vice versa. You have the ability to knock a random person down but are incapable due to rationality in your mind. Understand the difference?

> ##### Capability refers to the higher level of ability that could be demonstrated under the right conditions

So how to deal with the disillusion of ability and capability? Leave no room for self-doubt. Analyze the situation, understand and convince yourself, that circumstances created at that moment restricted your ability, making you incapable at that moment. Never ever doubt these decisions that you made. Hammer this reasoning into your mind. You may be wrong, but no person here is completely right. And who would you prove your righteousness to? Ultimately yourself. At least you convinced yourself to prevent self-doubting. You miss 100% of the shots you don't take. No doubt about that. But YOU chose to LEAVE the shot, you knew your state of mind at that moment. You NEVER doubt these decisions that you made. Cause ultimately...

> ##### I'm the master of my fate, I'm the Captain of my soul.
